* Overview

  My static web site (the one you're reading right now) is hosted in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket with a
  horrific endpoint address (something like http://tarheel-nc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

  I'd love to make it something like http://static.how-hard-can-it-be.com/, BUT Oracle DynDNS for
  poor home users like me doesn't allow the creation of NS records for subdomains.

  Also, Oracle is charging me $5/month ($60/year, for those who didn't do the math yet), which is
  quite a bit more than they used to charge, so it's probably time to switch.

  Moving to the "Pro" package (presumably to get this subdomain functionality) at Oracle would cost
  me an /additional/ $50/year, so... no thanks.

  Amazon charges $0.50/month per zone (and I think I'd only have one, =how-hard-can-it-be.com=) plus
  $0.40 per /million/ queries per month.  DynDNS reports that they field on the order of 10,000
  queries/month (probably for all the spam email they route over to Google for me), so I think I'm
  safe.

  This is my journal of how I'm getting that done.

* IN-PROGRESS Assess current usage

** TODO "MX" records for mail to Google

   email to <anybody>@how-hard-can-it-be.com goes to Google.

** TODO "TXT" records for verification of ownership of =how-hard-can-it-be.com= domain
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: txt-record
   :END:

   Related to [[#cname-record]["CNAME" record]].
   
   Why do I even have this?  Looks like it's for Google sites, which is where
   =www.how-hard-can-it-be.com= is.

   So, I guess I'll need to set up a new verification using instructions at Google sites.

** TODO "CNAME" alias record record for my Google web site
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cname-record
   :END:

   Related to [[#txt-record]["TXT" record]].

** TODO "A" record(s) for my home computer(s) so I can ssh in from wherever
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-records-for-home-computers
   :END:

   I'll need a script that lives on my home computer(s) to handle this.  At some point, I'll need it
   for a Windows machine if my next purchase is an Intel NUC or some such.

   See https://medium.com/@avishayil/dynamic-dns-using-aws-route-53-60a2331a58a4

*** TODO MS-Windows version

** TODO "A" record for my wiki running on an AWS EC2 instance

   (See [[file:using-aws.org][using-aws.org]], [[file:jspwiki-setup.org][jspwiki-setup.org]].)

   Similar (to [[#a-records-for-home-computers]["A" record(s) for my home computer(s)]]) need for dynamic DNS update script.
