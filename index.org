* Overview

  So, this is my dumb Amazon S3 static web site bucket.

  :)

* Stuff Of Interest

  (Depending on how you define "interest", of course.)

  - [[file:Orgzly/hugo.html][Orgzly/hugo.html]] :: This is the HTML version of an [[http://www.orgzly.com/][Orgzly]] file I first created on my phone.  It's not necessarily
       up-to-date, since I'm updating HTML manually now (updates to slow, really; plus worried about accidentally
       deploying live.js to my S3 bucket and racking up unnecessary charges w/one-second refresh cycle).  Original
       org-mode version is here:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ji4ziwzxqxu81ei/hugo.org?dl=0

  - [[file:aws-s3-powershell-and-cli.org][aws-s3-powershell-and-cli.org]] :: Notes on using PowerShell to keep an AWS S3 bucket up to date.

  - [[file:haskell-newtype-errors.org][haskell-newtype-errors.org]] :: Notes on Errors Encountered While Trying to Use Newtype to Declare a Type an Instance
       of Functor

  - [[file:free-orion-tech-research.svg][free-orion-tech-research.svg]] :: An SVG I generated (using GraphViz) of technologies to research in FreeOrion.
       Original input is [[file:free-orion-tech-research.txt]].

  - SubDir :: A subdirectory
    - [[file:SubDir/another-file.html][another-file.html]] :: Just a random HTML file I hacked up.

    - [[file:SubDir/some-org-mode-garbage.org][some-org-mode-garbage.org]] :: An org file in a subdirectory.

* Play

  Verbatim: =verbatim=

  Code: ~code~

  =maybe we like equal signs better_3^2= since "code" seems to be fairly loaded in org-mode (implications of execution
  and whatnot).

* COMMENT Org-mode explainer

  Text markup.  More stars means lower-level items.  Blank lines between paragraphs.  Indentation doesn't matter (except
  for lists).  *bold* /italic/ ~code~ =verbatim= (probably should use ~code~ instead of =verbatim=).  [[#maintaining-this-file][Internal link]].
  [[https://google.com][Link to Google]] (although just pasting in a URL works fine, too (see "more info", below)).

  Subscript: H_{2}O (so don't paste in ~code_with_underscores~ w/out surrounding it with ~'s).  (Superscript: E = mc^2.)

  : one-line code sample
  : ok, maybe two lines

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Multi-line example
    like maybe a pasted email
    or something you don't want line-wrapping or other /character interpretation/ applied to
  #+END_EXAMPLE 

  Bullet lists:
  
  - one
  - two
    - sub-item (indentation matters here)

  Definitions:
  
  - terms :: Can be defined

  Checklists:
  
  - [ ] Items can be...
  - [X] ...checked off
  - [-] And (dash means "partially completed")
    - [X] you can have sublists
    - [ ] if you really want to

** Maintaining this file without emacs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: maintaining-this-file
   :END:

   If you want to update the contents of this file and you're not an emacs user (i.e., you're a normal person), you
   /might/ be able to use pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) to render this text file to whatever format you like.

   See [[*on processing this file with Pandoc][COMMENT on processing this file with Pandoc]].

   (You might also be able to do it by installing emacs and using it as a command-line processor, but I haven't figured
   that out quite yet.)

   Alternatively, you can just DELETE the generated HTML file (including in any repositories where it exists) and update
   this text file without attempting to regenerate the HTML.  In the end, it's just text.

* COMMENT on processing this file with Pandoc
  
  There is a program, ~pandoc~ (https://pandoc.org/), which can be used to turn this org-mode file into whatever you
  want.

  If you do use Pandoc, try the following command line:

  : pandoc --from=org --to=html5 --standalone --table-of-contents --toc-depth=6 --variable=secnumdepth:6 --number-sections --include-in-header=pandoc-header-extra.html --output=<output-html-file> <this-file>
