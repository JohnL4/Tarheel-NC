* Overview

  This is some org-mode garbage.

* COMMENT Org-mode explainer

  Text markup.  More stars means lower-level items.  Blank lines between paragraphs.  Indentation doesn't matter (except
  for lists).  *bold* /italic/ ~code~ =verbatim= (probably should use ~code~ instead of =verbatim=).  [[#maintaining-this-file][Internal link]].
  [[https://google.com][Link to Google]] (although just pasting in a URL works fine, too (see "more info", below)).

  Subscript: H_{2}O (so don't paste in ~code_with_underscores~ w/out surrounding it with ~'s).  (Superscript: E = mc^2.)

  : one-line code sample
  : ok, maybe two lines

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Multi-line example
    like maybe a pasted email
    or something you don't want line-wrapping or other /character interpretation/ applied to
  #+END_EXAMPLE 

  Bullet lists:
  
  - one
  - two
    - sub-item (indentation matters here)

  Definitions:
  
  - terms :: Can be defined

  Checklists:
  
  - [ ] Items can be...
  - [X] ...checked off
  - [-] And (dash means "partially completed")
    - [X] you can have sublists
    - [ ] if you really want to

** Maintaining this file without emacs

   If you want to update the contents of this file and you're not an emacs user (i.e., you're a normal person), you
   /might/ be able to use pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) to render this text file to whatever format you like.

   See [[*on processing this file with Pandoc][COMMENT on processing this file with Pandoc]].

   (You might also be able to do it by installing emacs and using it as a command-line processor, but I haven't figured
   that out quite yet.)

   Alternatively, you can just DELETE the generated HTML file (including in any repositories where it exists) and update
   this text file without attempting to regenerate the HTML.  In the end, it's just text.

* COMMENT on processing this file with Pandoc
  
  There is a program, ~pandoc~ (https://pandoc.org/), which can be used to turn this org-mode file into whatever you
  want.

  If you do use Pandoc, try the following command line:

  : pandoc --from=org --to=html5 --standalone --table-of-contents --toc-depth=6 --variable=secnumdepth:6 --number-sections --include-in-header=pandoc-header-extra.html --output=<output-html-file> <this-file>
